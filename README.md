# Doungeonbomb
This is a project from a copying assignment whose reference is Doungeonball from sokpop (original here → [Dungeonball by Sokpop Collective (itch.io)](https://sokpop.itch.io/dungeonball)). I've deconstructed and recreated parts of Doungeonball as best as I can with the skills I currently have, but there are still a lot of hard parts I can't do yet. I did however add some unique content such as my favourite bomb ball!  
In simple words, it's a very simple and fun game of picking up various items and then throwing them at your enemies. You'll need to explore the different rooms to find a way to get into the final room, break the crystal and destroy all the enemies!  
If you're interested in this, please leave a comment to help me improve them!

How to play:

*   Use W/A/S/D to move.
*   Use the left/right mouse buttons to control the left and right hand, respectively, to pick up and throw items.
